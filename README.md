7.5 MW biomass based Power Project by SCPL, India
______________________________
This is a biomass-based power project located in village Rangpur of Kota district in the state of Rajasthan (India), promoted/operated by Suryaa Chamball Power Limited. The project activity had installed and has been in operation of one steam turbine generator having capacity of 7500 kW where steam is fed from biomass fired boiler. Thus, project activity utilises the renewable biomass for generation of reneable electricity and also contributes to sustainable development in the region.

The total capacity of the project is 7.5 MW. The main purpose of the project activity is to generate
and export green power to the Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited (RRVPNL), which
is a transmission company of the Rajasthan State Electricity Board (RSEB). SCPL is a public
limited company. SCPL has implemented the power plant near village Rangpur, District Kota in
Rajasthan.

Authorized Project Contact: Suryaa Chamball Power Limited

The project activity utilises the renewable biomass for generation of electricity. The setting up of
fossil fuel-based power projects leads to the GHG emission which is a severe concern globally,
while this project utilizing biomass (a renewable source), which is sufficiently available within 50 km
diameter of selected location.

Biomass being a renewable source and considering the established fact that there would be no net
emissions of CO2 (GHG) from such renewable energy projects, this ‘project activity’ will also lead
to no net onsite emissions in comparison to the emissions from the alternative fossil fuel-based
power plants.

The project activity helps in reducing the ever-increasing demand and supply gap of electricity
besides contributing towards economic growth and development of the area. The project activity
apart from generating employment locally will provide economic value to the agricultural wastes
and will provide stable and quality power to the local industry, farmers and households. The project
will also create a business opportunity for local stakeholders such as bankers/consultants,
equipment suppliers, equipment manufacturers, contractors, biomass suppliers, farmers, local
community and the related. The following are some additional benefits of the project:
 Appropriate utilisation of surplus biomass
 Avoidance of burning of wasted agricultural residues
 Generation of environment friendly green power
 Reduction in Green House Gas (GHG) i.e. CO2 emissions
